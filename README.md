## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)

cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

2. For local development with React Native:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx expo start
```

### Testing Device Discovery and Pairing

The app includes a simulated discovery and pairing flow that you can test without actual Android TV devices:

1. Launch the app and navigate to the discovery screen
2. The app will automatically discover simulated TV devices on your "network"
3. Select a device from the list to begin the pairing process
4. When prompted for a PIN, enter `1234` (this is the test PIN for all simulated devices)
5. After successful pairing, you'll be taken to the remote control screen
6. You can test all remote control functions which will simulate sending commands to the TV

### Demo Credentials

For testing the premium features during development:

- Test PIN for all devices: `1234`
- Test User ID: (automatically generated)
- Test Period: 1 day free trial
